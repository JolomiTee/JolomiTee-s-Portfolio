# JolomiTee's-Portfolio

So i took a look at my old web portfolio, good old HTML, CSS and Javascript, and then I thought... why not build a version of it with the tech that is frying the plantain in these times?

Basically, I'm recreating the template but as a react app, just to have something doing for the mean time.
