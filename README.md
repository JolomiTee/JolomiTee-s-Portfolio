# JolomiTee's-Portfolio
So i took a look at my old web portfolio, good old TML, CSS and Javascript, and then I thought...why not build a React version of it? since thats the tech that is frying the plantain in these times?

Basically, I'm recreating the template but as a react app, just to have something doing for the mean time.
